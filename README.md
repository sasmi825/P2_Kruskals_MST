# Introduction

I am implementing of kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree and analyzing the complexity of the algorithm theoretically and experimentally.

# How to Run
Kruskals algorithm has been implemented using Python both in Jupyter Notebook and in the main.py file.
Please download .ipynb note book open it in jupyter notebook and run the cells. Or run the following command

```
# runs for following four values: 10, 100, 1000, 10000
$ python main.py
```

`main.py` generates a random graph, applies Kruskals algorithm to find MST, gathers time taken, and plots the experimental time and theoretical time in a 3D graph. 
`requirement.txt` file contains the necessary libraries required to run the repo.
